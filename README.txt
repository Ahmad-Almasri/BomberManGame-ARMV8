I tried my best to use Makefile but it did not work. I have uploaded it with the files anyway.
I made a script file instead you just need to --> change .txt to .sh and then chmod +x script.sh

the length of player name has been set to 9 chars only. Because I am using only svc, If you want more there is a variable in file "topDoc.asm" called "namelength = 10". the extra char (number 10 is the ',') is just for arranging data at the file.

The file that called loadValue.asm is responsible for most of load and store data on this program.
